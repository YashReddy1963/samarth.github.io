            <p> I am a second-year E&TC student at N. K. Orchid College of Engineering and Technology in Solapur with a strong interest in software development, particularly in Google Cloud. My skills include proficiency in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, HTML, and CSS. I have studied and completed programs related to cloud technologies such as Google Cloud, AWS Data Analytics, and Oracle Cloud Infra.
                <br><br>
                I have attended various events and programs such as Devfest Belgaum, Google Cloud Ready Facilitator Program, and practitioner programs, which have helped me to improve my technical skills related to Cloud Console. Moreover, I have recently completed the AZ-400 Exam, which covered designing and implementing Microsoft DevOps solutions, and completed various badges, including "Cloud Engineering is the Path." 
                <br><br>
                I believe in the infinite nature of learning, and I am always eager to explore new things and expand my knowledge.
